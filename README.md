# CoreBond SDK (Developer Preview)

Hardware-rooted identity. No stored keys. No key exchange.

Identity is derived from physical device characteristics rather than stored credentials.

This developer preview demonstrates:
- Device-level entropy signals  
- Identity comparison  
- Replay-resistant verification  

---

## Run the Demo

Run from the repository root directory.

### Commands

pip install numpy  
python run_demo.py  

### Expected Output

=== CoreBond Demo ===

Device A vs A: AUTHENTIC  
Device A vs B: REJECT  

Run time: < 1 second. No setup beyond Python + NumPy.

---

## What This Shows

- Signals from the same device are consistent  
- Signals from different devices are distinguishable  
- Identity can be verified without stored keys  

This behavior has been observed across multiple physical devices with consistent separation between legitimate and non-matching signals under repeated cold boot conditions.

---

## Why This Matters

Traditional systems rely on stored secrets or transmitted keys.

CoreBond demonstrates a different model:
- No stored keys  
- No key exchange  
- Identity derived from physical device characteristics  

This model eliminates dependence on stored credentials entirely.

This removes entire classes of key extraction and replay attacks.

## Next Steps

Exploring hardware-rooted identity for real-world systems?

CoreBond is currently in active prototype validation.
